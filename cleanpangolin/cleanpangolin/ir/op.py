    Abstract base class for operators.
    An `Op` represents a deterministic function or conditional distribution.
    Note that it *only* represents itâ€”all functionality for sampling or density
    evaluation, etc. is left to inference engines.
    * Frozen after creation.
    * `__eq__` should be defined so that *mathematically equivalent*
    `CondDist`s are equal, regardless of if they occupy the same place in memory.
    Unnecessary for pre-defined `CondDist` objects like `normal_scale` or `add`,
    but needed for `CondDist`s that are constructed with parameters, like `VMapDist`.
    * Some `CondDist`s, e.g. multivariate normal distributions, can have different
    shapes depending on the shapes of the parents. So a concrete `CondDist` must
    provide a `_get_shape(*parents_shapes)` method to resolve this.
