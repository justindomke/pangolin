# TODO: some day merge "indexes into indexes"
# - this seems to NOT be very simpleâ€”all depends on shapes of inputs and stuff)

# - but for Stan or JAGS seems problematic?
# - (or should we solve in the codegen phase?)

def index(var:RV, *indices:RV | slice):
    """
    Convenience function to create a new indexed RV.

    Note: Users are not expected to call this function directly. Instead they should just use
    normal indexing notation like `x[y]`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    var: RV
        the RV to be indexed
    indices
        each element of `indices` must either be (a) a slice with fixed integer indices, (b) an RV
        with integer values, or (c) something that can be cast to a constant. The length of
        `indices` is permitted to be less than `var.ndim`. If so, extra full slices are added for
        all missing dimensions.
    Returns
    -------
    new_rv: RV
        The new indexed RV, conceptually equivalent to `var[*indices]`.
