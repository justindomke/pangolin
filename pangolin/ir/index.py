"""
An Index is a deterministic `Op` that takes (1) an RV to be indexed and (2) a set of (
integer-valued) indexing RVs and returns the result of indexing the first RV with the second.

Conceptually, say the user does something like this:

```python
x = constant([1,2,3])
i = categorical([.1,.2,.7])
y = x[i]
```

Then we would like this to lead to an IR something like:

```python
x = RV(Constant([1,2,3]))
p = RV(Constant([.1,.2,.7])
y = RV(Index(),x,i)
```

Seems simple, right? But there are two major subtleties:

**First subtlety.** Given the above description, you might think that the Index Op itself would
need no parameters—there aren't "different kinds" of indexing, after all. And we want to allow
indices to be random variables.

But there is a problem: We also want to allow indexing with *slices* and if *slices* are defined
with random variables, then the *size* of the output would also be random, which would break our
abstraction where all RVs have fixed shapes.

To deal with this, there are different instances of `Index` Ops, depending on what dimensions
will be sliced. All slices must be baked into the Index `Op` with *fixed* integer values. Then,
all the non-sliced arguments are still free to be `RV`s. So an `Index` Op is created by givin a
list of slices, each can either be a fixed slice, or `None`, indicating that the dimension is
unsliced and will come from a `RV`.

So, for example, if you do this:

```python
x = constant([[1,2,3],[4,5,6])
i = categorical([.1,.2,.7])
y = x[:,i]
```

then under the hood you will get a representation like

```python
x = RV(Constant([1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
p = RV(Constant([.1,.2,.7])
i = RV(Categorical,p)
y = RV(Index(slice(None),None),x,i)
```

**Second subtlety.** We would like to support substantially all of Numpy's indexing features. But
Numpy's indexing is much weirder than most people realize. For example, consider this code:

```python
A = np.ones([2,3,4,5])
i = [0,1,0,1,0,1]
A[i,i,:,:].shape # (6,4,5) # ok
A[:,:,i,i].shape # (2,3,6) # ok
A[:,i,i,:].shape # (2,6,5) # fine
A[i,:,:,i].shape # (6,3,4) # ok, I guess
A[:,i,:,i].shape # (6,2,4) # what!?
```

Yes, that is really what happens, try it! What's happening here is that when you have multiple
"advanced indices" (like `i`) above, numpy has very complicated [advanced indexing rules](
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html#advanced-indexing). These basically say that:

1. If all the advanced indices are next to each other, then the corresponding dimension in the
output goes at the location of the *first* advanced index.

2. If the advanced indices are separated by any slices, then the corresponding dimension goes at
the *start* in the output.

We just have to live with this, but it complicates things quite a bit.

**Note:** There is one indexing feature from numpy that is *not* supported at the moment,
namely broadcasting of indices. For example, in Pangolin, you cannot write `x[3,[0,1,2]]` as a
shorthand for `x[[3,3,3],[0,1,2]]`. We might change this at some point if there is some need.

**Note** As illustrated above, non-sliced indices are free to be random variables. Although,
currently, JAGS is the only backend that can actually do inference in these settings.
